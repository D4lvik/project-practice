Annotation:
With the onset of the lockdown, many people were left locked in their homes without the opportunity to carry on their old way of life. One of the most important aspects of life in modern society is working on your skills and health. The onset of the lockdown brought big changes in many social areas. One of the most important changes was the lack of physical activity, which led to a deterioration in people's health.
Our application is designed to help people who are trapped at home, follow the cut of trainings to maintain their health. Our application provides a collection of physical exercises and helps you choose a home workout regimen for different groups of people.

7) Come up with a scheme for distributing and accessing the application.
8) Test the alpha version of the application (eliminate application errors, check the algorithm for forming the training program based on user data).
9) Share the application with a group of people for general testing.
10) Make adjustments and suggestions to the app after collecting feedback after alpha testing.
11) Connect a payment system to provide access to a wider variety of exercise.
12) Hire fitness trainers to record exercise instruction videos.
13) Make adjustments to the UI taking into account the introduction of new functionality.
14) Apply to publish the application on distribution sites (Google Play, App Store).
